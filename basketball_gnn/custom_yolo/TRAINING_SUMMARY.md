   ```bash
   python test_cpu_model.py
   ```

2. **Integrate with GNN:**
   ```bash
   python gnn_integration.py
   # Choose option 1: Custom trained model
   # Enter model path: basketball_yolo_training/basketball_v20250802_230623/weights/best.pt
   ```

3. **Analyze Basketball Videos:**
   ```bash
   python ../analyze_video.py your_basketball_video.mp4
   ```

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT

**✅ Successfully created automated custom YOLO training system that:**

- **Generates its own basketball dataset** (no user data required)
- **Trains custom basketball object detection** (5 classes)
- **Optimizes for available hardware** (CPU/GPU auto-detection)
