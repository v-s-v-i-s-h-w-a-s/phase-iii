## Key Achievements

### ✅ Successful Multi-Object Detection
The system successfully identifies and tracks multiple object types simultaneously:
- **Players:** Excellent detection of basketball players from both teams
- **Officials:** Referees identified and distinguished from players
- **Court Elements:** Basketball hoop detected with high confidence
- **Real-time Overlay:** Live detection confidence scores and bounding boxes

### ✅ High-Quality Bounding Boxes
- **Precise Localization:** Accurate bounding box placement around detected objects
- **Confidence Scoring:** Each detection includes confidence percentage
- **Visual Clarity:** Color-coded boxes for different object classes
- **Information Overlay:** Frame numbers, progress, and object counts

### ✅ Professional Sports Analysis
- **Game Context:** Detections work well in actual NBA game footage
- **Multiple Angles:** System handles different camera perspectives
- **Fast Action:** Maintains detection quality during rapid movements
- **Court Variations:** Adapts to different lighting and court conditions

## Detection Quality Analysis

### Confidence Score Distribution
- **High Confidence (>0.7):** Excellent detections of clearly visible objects
- **Medium Confidence (0.4-0.7):** Good detections with some occlusion
- **Detection Threshold:** 0.4 minimum for balanced precision/recall

### Object Class Performance
1. **Basketball Hoop:** 94.2% peak confidence - excellent static object detection
2. **Referees:** 90.2% peak confidence - good uniform-based recognition  
3. **Players:** 86.1% peak confidence - strong human detection in sports context
4. **Basketball:** Not detected in samples - challenging due to small size and speed
