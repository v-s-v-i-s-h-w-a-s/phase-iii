# Basketball Play Creator - AI-Powered Coaching Tool

## 🏀 Overview

An intelligent basketball play creator that translates natural language descriptions into animated 2D visualizations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for player tracking, play prediction, and tactical optimization.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Describe plays in plain English
- **AI-Powered Animation**: GNN-based player movement simulation
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: ML-driven play optimization
- **Real-time Visualization**: Smooth 2D court animations
- **Play Library**: Extensive database of standard basketball plays
- **Team Analytics**: Formation analysis and tactical insights

### Core Components

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Text/voice input processing
2. **NLP Parser**: Converts descriptions to structured play commands
3. **Play Database**: Standard plays and custom playbooks
4. **GNN Dynamics Engine**: Player movement and interaction modeling
5. **2D Animation Module**: Court visualization and animation
6. **Analytics Engine**: Play optimization and recommendations

## 🚀 Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.8+** with Flask/FastAPI
- **PyTorch Geometric** for GNN implementation
- **spaCy/Transformers** for NLP processing
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage

### Frontend  
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Konva.js** for 2D canvas animation
- **Material-UI** for component library
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates

### Machine Learning
- **PyTorch** for model training
- **Hugging Face** for language models
- **scikit-learn** for clustering and analytics

## 📊 Data Sources

- NBA SportVU tracking data (2015-16 season)
- Basketball play libraries and coaching resources
- Synthetic training data for edge cases
- User-generated plays and feedback

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Natural Language Input
```
"Run a pick and roll with PG and C, then SG cuts to corner for 3-pointer"
"Set up zone defense with center protecting paint"
"Execute quick inbound play - pass to wing, screen for shooter"
```

### API Usage
```python
from basketball_play_creator import PlayCreator

creator = PlayCreator()
play = creator.parse_play("PG drives left, center sets screen")
animation = creator.simulate_play(play)
creator.visualize(animation)
```

## 🔧 Installation

# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd basketball_play_creator

# Backend setup
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Frontend setup  
cd ../frontend
